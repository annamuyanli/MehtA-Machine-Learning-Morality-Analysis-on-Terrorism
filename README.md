# Morality Analysis on Tweets Following Terrorist Attacks Using Natural Language Processing

Previous research has shown that after a terrorist attack, people demonstrate an increase in salience of moral institutions such as the respect for authority and purity due to the need for social cohesion. Using sentiment analysis and machine learning classification models on Twitter tweets after the El Paso terrorist attack and Las Vegas terrorist attack, we intend to extend the previous research on a bigger database in this research study. After hand annotating 900 tweets with each of five morality, we use Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify the tweets into 5 moral intuitions. Comparing the percentage of tweets that express each moral foundation category, we find that our comprehension of the El Paso attack is aligned with the previous studies, but our conclusion of the Vegas attack does not. This paper documents how we utilize machine learning models to classify peopleâ€™s morality and record our findings on the sentiment of tweets after a terrorist attack.
